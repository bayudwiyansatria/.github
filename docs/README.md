# Custom GitHub Actions Workflow Overview

This document provides an overview of the custom GitHub Actions workflow defined in the repository. The workflow is designed to automate key tasks, such as testing, building, and deploying your project, making it easier for contributors to work with the repository and ensuring consistency across deployments.

## Workflow Purpose

The custom workflow automates the following tasks:

- **Automated Testing**: Runs tests to ensure the integrity of the codebase with every change.
- **Build Process**: Builds the project (if applicable).
- **Deployment**: Deploys the project to the production/staging server (if defined in the workflow).

By automating these tasks, the workflow helps improve the development process and reduces the chances of errors or inconsistencies in the project.

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow is triggered by the following events:

- **Push**: When code is pushed to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
- **Pull Request**: When a pull request is created or updated.
- **Manual Trigger**: If configured, users can trigger the workflow manually from GitHub UI.

## Key Steps in the Workflow

1. **Checkout Code**: The code is checked out to ensure the latest version is available.
2. **Set Up Environment**: This step sets up the environment (e.g., installing Node.js, setting environment variables).
3. **Run Tests**: Executes unit tests or integration tests to validate the code.
4. **Build**: If required, the project is built (e.g., compiled, packaged).
5. **Deploy**: The project is deployed to the server or cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

## Benefits of Using This Workflow

- **Consistency**: Automates repetitive tasks to ensure the same steps are followed every time.
- **Faster Feedback**: Automatically runs tests and builds, allowing faster identification of issues.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Encourages team collaboration through automated PR checks and deployments.
